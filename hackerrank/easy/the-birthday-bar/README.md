# Subarray Division

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

Two children, Lily and Ron, want to share a chocolate bar. Each of the squares has an integer on it. 

Lily decides to share a contiguous segment of the bar selected such that: 

- The length of the segment matches Ron's birth month, and,
- The sum of the integers on the squares is equal to his birth day.

Determine how many ways she can divide the chocolate.

**Example**   
$s = [2, 2, 1, 3, 2]$    
$d = 4$   
$m = 2$   

Lily wants to find segments summing to Ron's birth day, $d = 4$ with a length equalling his birth month, $m = 2$.  In this case, there are two segments meeting her criteria: $[2, 2]$ and $[1,3]$.

**Function Description**

Complete the *birthday* function in the editor below.    

birthday has the following parameter(s):  

- *int s[n]:* the numbers on each of the squares of chocolate  
- *int d:* Ron's birth day  
- *int m:* Ron's birth month  

**Returns**   

- *int:* the number of ways the bar can be divided  



**Input Format**

The first line contains an integer $n$, the number of squares in the chocolate bar.  	
The second line contains $n$ space-separated integers $s[i]$, the numbers on the chocolate squares where $0 \le i \lt n$.  
The third line contains two space-separated integers, $d$ and $m$, Ron's birth day and his birth month.

**Constraints**

* ${1} \leq {n} \leq 100$  
* ${1}\leq {s[i]}\leq {5}$, where (${0}\leq {i} \lt {n}$)     
* ${1} \leq {d} \leq {31}$  
* ${1} \leq {m} \leq {12}$

            sum += s.get(i);
            sum -= s.get(i - m);

            if (sum == d) {
                count++;
            }

        return count;
    }

        BufferedReader br = new BufferedReader(new InputStreamReader(System.in));

        int n = Integer.parseInt(br.readLine().trim());

        StringTokenizer st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        List<Integer> s = new ArrayList<>();

        for (int i = 0; i < n; i++) {
            s.add(Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken()));
        }

        st = new StringTokenizer(br.readLine());
        int d = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());
        int m = Integer.parseInt(st.nextToken());

        System.out.println(birthday(s, d, m));
    }
}
