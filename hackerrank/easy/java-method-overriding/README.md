# Java Method Overriding

![Difficulty](https://img.shields.io/badge/Difficulty-Easy-green)

## Problem

When a subclass inherits from a superclass, it also inherits its methods; however, it can also *override* the superclass methods (as well as declare and implement new ones). Consider the following *Sports* class:

```java
class Sports{
    String getName(){
        return "Generic Sports";
    }
    void getNumberOfTeamMembers(){
        System.out.println( "Each team has n players in " + getName() );
    }
}
```

Next, we create a *Soccer* class that inherits from the *Sports* class. We can override the *getName* method and return a different, subclass-specific string:

```java
class Soccer extends Sports{
    @Override
    String getName(){
        return "Soccer Class";
    }
}
```

**Note:** When overriding a method, you should precede it with the `@Override` annotation. The parameter(s) and return type of an overridden method must be exactly the same as those of the method inherited from the supertype. 

----

**Task**	
Complete the code in your editor by writing an overridden *getNumberOfTeamMembers* method that prints the same statement as the superclass' *getNumberOfTeamMembers* method, except that it replaces $n$ with $11$ (the number of players on a Soccer team). 

**Input Format**

 

**Constraints**

 

**Output Format**

When executed, your completed code should print the following:

    Generic Sports
    Each team has n players in Generic Sports
    Soccer Class
    Each team has 11 players in Soccer Class

        return "Soccer Class";
    }

    @Override
    void getNumberOfTeamMembers() {
        System.out.println("Each team has 11 players in " + getName());
    }
}

public class Solution {

    public static void main(String[] args) {

        Sports c1 = new Sports();
        Soccer c2 = new Soccer();

        System.out.println(c1.getName());
        c1.getNumberOfTeamMembers();

        System.out.println(c2.getName());
        c2.getNumberOfTeamMembers();
    }
}
```
